2. What is the core problem, blockchain trying to solve?

There are trying to solve 3 main steps:
Based on decentralization blockchain primarily solving authenticity, security, and need to powerful third-party trust for removing the problems.

3. What are the Few Features which blockchain will give you?

a. verifiable

b. unchangeable

c. Security

Example:

Block 1:
0 + Data in the block = Block Signature
Block 2:
Previous Block Signature + Data in the New Block = Current Block Signature
